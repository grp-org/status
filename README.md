# Peyronnet Group Status Page

This repository contains the source code for the Peyronnet Group Status Page, a Next.js React TypeScript application built using [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui). The status page provides real-time and historical information on the operational status of various services provided by the Peyronnet Group.

## Project Structure

The project's directory structure is as follows:

```
└── 📁app
    └── 📁incidents

            └── page.tsx          // Dynamic page for each incident
        └── incident.mdx          // Incidents are stored in MDX files
        └── page.tsx              // Page displaying a list of incidents
    └── favicon.ico
    └── globals.css
    └── layout.tsx                 // Main layout file
    └── page.tsx                   // Home page of the status site

## Usage

### Viewing Incidents

To view the list of all incidents, navigate to the homepage. You can click on any incident to view detailed information.

### Adding a New Incident

To document a new incident:

1. Use the CLI tool to create a new incident file.

   ```bash
   node ./cli/create_incident.js
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to enter the incident details, such as date, title, and description.

3. The new incident will be automatically created in the `app/incidents/` directory and listed on the incidents page.

### Editing an Existing Incident

To edit an existing incident:

1. Use the CLI tool to edit the incident file.

   ```bash
   node ./cli/edit_incident.js
   ```

2. Select the incident you wish to edit from the list and follow the prompts.

3. The message you added will automatically be appended to the description of the incident.

## CLI Tools

The `cli` directory contains scripts to help automate the process of creating and editing incidents.

- **`create_incident.js` & `create_incident.ts`**: These scripts allow you to create a new incident by prompting you for the necessary details (date, title, description) and then generating an `.mdx` file in the `app/incidents/` directory.

- **`edit_incident.js` & `edit_incident.ts`**: These scripts enable you to edit an existing incident. They list all incidents and allow you to select one for editing.

### Usage Example

To create a new incident, simply run:

```bash
node ./cli/create_incident.js
```

This will guide you through the process of adding a new incident.
